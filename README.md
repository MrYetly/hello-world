# hello-world
Just starting things out
I'm interested in helping spread renewable energy throughout the world, but in the mean time I'd like to take on as many challanges along the way as I can. I want to help my friend who works for Generation Schools Network, if I can. And I'd like to increase the sophistication, capabilities, and user-friendliness of a personal finance tool I've created.
